        "### Explanation of Text Preprocessing Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "Text preprocessing is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that transforms raw text into a more suitable and analyzable format. This process helps to reduce noise, standardize text, and improve the performance of subsequent NLP tasks such as text similarity analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Lowercasing**: This step converts all characters in the text to lowercase. The purpose is to treat words like \"Apple\" and \"apple\" as the same word, preventing the model from considering them as distinct entities solely due to capitalization differences. This standardizes the text and reduces the vocabulary size.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Punctuation and Number Removal**: This involves eliminating punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas, question marks) and numerical digits from the text. The primary reason is that these characters often do not contribute to the semantic meaning of the text and can introduce noise or increase dimensionality without adding value to the similarity calculation. For example, 'hello!' and 'hello' should be treated similarly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Stopword Removal**: Stopwords are common words (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"a\", \"an\") that appear frequently in a language but usually carry little semantic meaning and do not help in distinguishing between documents. Removing them reduces the dimensionality of the feature space and allows the analysis to focus on more significant words that convey actual meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Tokenization**: Tokenization is the process of breaking down a continuous stream of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, subwords, or even characters. For similarity analysis, word tokenization is commonly used to segment sentences into individual words, which are then processed further.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Lemmatization**: Lemmatization is the process of reducing inflected words to their base or root form, known as a lemma. Unlike stemming, which often just chops off suffixes, lemmatization uses a vocabulary and morphological analysis to return the dictionary form of a word. For instance, \"running\", \"runs\", and \"ran\" would all be reduced to \"run\". This helps to group together different inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item, improving the accuracy of semantic analysis."

While BoW simply counts word occurrences, TF-IDF weighs words by how frequently they appear in a document relative to their frequency across all documents. This approach allows TF-IDF to downplay common words (like 'the', 'is') that might appear in many sentences but offer little discriminative power, and emphasize rarer, more significant terms. This characteristic makes TF-IDF particularly effective for text similarity tasks, as it provides a more nuanced representation of semantic content by highlighting words that are truly important to a document's meaning, leading to more accurate similarity scores."

        "### Interpretation of Cosine Similarity Results\n",
        "\n",
        "Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space. In the context of text analysis, these vectors typically represent documents (or sentences) and are often derived from TF-IDF values. A cosine similarity score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates identical content, 0 indicates no commonality, and values in between represent varying degrees of similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's interpret some sample results from our `sentence_pairs_df`:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Pair 0: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" vs \"A cat sat on the mat.\"**\n",
        "    *   **Cosine Similarity: 1.000000**\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation:** This pair has a perfect similarity score of 1.0. After preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, lemmatization), both sentences become \"cat sat mat\". They are semantically and lexically identical in their core meaning. This high score correctly reflects their high degree of similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Pair 1: \"He is a fast runner.\" vs \"He runs quickly.\"**\n",
        "    *   **Cosine Similarity: 0.000000**\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation:** This pair shows a cosine similarity of 0.0. After preprocessing, \"fast runner\" and \"run quickly\" share no common words that were not stopwords or lemmatized differently into non-matching tokens. While semantically related (both describe speed), the specific word choices and their processed forms resulted in completely disjoint TF-IDF vectors, leading to a zero similarity score. This highlights that while Cosine Similarity is good for lexical overlap, it may miss nuanced semantic similarity without more advanced techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Pair 3: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" vs \"A lazy dog was jumped over by the quick brown fox.\"**\n",
        "    *   **Cosine Similarity: 0.788127**\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation:** This pair has a high similarity score of approximately 0.79. Both sentences describe the same event using almost the same set of words, just with different grammatical structures (active vs. passive voice and word order). After preprocessing, a significant number of their key terms (quick, brown, fox, jump, lazy, dog) are common to both, leading to strong vector alignment and thus a high cosine similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Pair 6: \"She purchased a new automobile.\" vs \"She bought a new car.\"**\n",
        "    *   **Cosine Similarity: 0.290852**\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation:** This pair exhibits a moderate to low similarity score of about 0.29. While \"purchased\" is a synonym for \"bought\" and \"automobile\" is a synonym for \"car\", the TF-IDF model primarily relies on exact word matches (or lemmatized forms). Since 'purchased' and 'bought' are distinct tokens after lemmatization ('purchase' vs 'buy'), and 'automobile' and 'car' are also distinct, the lexical overlap is limited to 'new'. This results in a lower score than if the words were identical, indicating that TF-IDF with basic preprocessing might struggle with synonyms.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Pair 9: \"The sun rises in the east.\" vs \"The moon shines at night.\"**\n",
        "    *   **Cosine Similarity: 0.000000**\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation:** This pair has a cosine similarity of 0.0. The sentences describe entirely different celestial events and objects, even though both relate to the sky. After preprocessing (sun rise east vs moon shine night), there is no shared vocabulary, resulting in orthogonal vectors and a zero similarity score. This correctly reflects their complete dissimilarity in terms of lexical content."

        "### Interpretation of WordNet-based Semantic Similarity\n",
        "\n",
        "WordNet is a large lexical database of English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. WordNet-based semantic similarity metrics leverage these relationships (e.g., hypernymy/hyponymy, meronymy/holonymy) to quantify how semantically close two words are, even if they don't share any characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike Cosine and Jaccard similarities, which primarily rely on lexical overlap (i.e., whether the same words or their lemmatized forms appear in both texts), WordNet-based similarity attempts to capture the *meaning* relationship between words. For example, 'car' and 'automobile' are synonyms, but would appear as distinct tokens to Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF. WordNet, however, can identify them as highly similar because their synsets are closely related.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `wordnet_word_similarity` function used here calculates the Wu-Palmer (wup) similarity between two words. Wu-Palmer similarity measures the depth of the least common subsumer (LCS) of two synsets in the WordNet hierarchy, combined with the depth of the synsets themselves. A higher score (up to 1.0) indicates greater semantic relatedness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's interpret some sample results from our `WordNet_Similarity` column, focusing on how it differs from lexical methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Pair 0: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" vs \"A cat sat on the mat.\"**\n",
        "    *   **Processed S1:** `[cat, sat, mat]`\n",
        "    *   **Processed S2:** `[cat, sat, mat]`\n",
        "    *   **WordNet Similarity: 1.000000**\n",
        "    *   **Comparison:** As with Cosine and Jaccard, WordNet similarity correctly identifies these as perfectly similar. Since the processed token sets are identical, the word-level similarities for 'cat' with 'cat', 'sat' with 'sat', etc., will all be 1.0, leading to an overall score of 1.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Pair 1: \"He is a fast runner.\" vs \"He runs quickly.\"**\n",
        "    *   **Processed S1:** `[fast, runner]`\n",
        "    *   **Processed S2:** `[run, quickly]`\n",
        "    *   **WordNet Similarity: 0.850694**\n",
        "    *   **Comparison:** This is where WordNet shines compared to Cosine and Jaccard (which both yielded 0.0). Even though 'fast' and 'run' are lexically different, WordNet can find a semantic relationship. Similarly, 'runner' (as a noun, referring to a person who runs) and 'run' (as a verb) are semantically very close. The score of 0.85 indicates a strong semantic connection, which is a much more accurate reflection of the sentence's meaning than 0.0.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Pair 6: \"She purchased a new automobile.\" vs \"She bought a new car.\"**\n",
        "    *   **Processed S1:** `[purchased, new, automobile]`\n",
        "    *   **Processed S2:** `[bought, new, car]`\n",
        "    *   **WordNet Similarity: 0.900898**\n",
        "    *   **Comparison:** This pair also demonstrates the strength of WordNet. Cosine (0.29) and Jaccard (0.20) scores were low due to the lack of lexical overlap for"

Before I can provide the required markdown interpretation of WordNet-based similarity on the complete dataset, I need to reinitialize the `sentence_pairs_df` with all original 10 pairs and recalculate all similarity metrics.

        "\n",
        "Comparing Cosine, Jaccard, and WordNet-based similarity methods reveals distinct strengths and weaknesses for text analysis. For short texts, all three methods can provide useful insights, but their performance varies depending on the nature of the similarity. Jaccard similarity, being set-based, depends heavily on the exact lexical overlap, making it sensitive to even slight word variations or the absence of common terms, as seen in cases where words were synonyms but not identical. Cosine similarity, particularly with TF-IDF, also relies significantly on exact word matching (or lemmatized forms), but can sometimes capture nuanced similarity better than Jaccard due to its consideration of term frequency weights, allowing for partial matches to contribute more. WordNet-based similarity, on the other hand, unequivocally captures meaning better, especially for short texts where synonyms or semantically related words are used. This is evident in examples like \"runner\" vs \"runs quickly\" or \"automobile\" vs \"car,\" where Cosine and Jaccard yielded low scores due to lexical differences, but WordNet provided much higher scores by identifying the underlying semantic relationships. Scores often disagreed when sentences contained semantically similar but lexically distinct words; in such scenarios, WordNet consistently outperformed the other two by recognizing the conceptual links. Conversely, for sentences with high lexical overlap but subtle semantic shifts, Jaccard and Cosine might still show higher scores than WordNet if the core shared terms heavily influence their metrics. In summary, while Cosine and Jaccard are excellent for lexical matching, WordNet is superior for understanding semantic intent, making it crucial when synonymy and conceptual relatedness are primary concerns."

This involves defining and preparing a dataset of sentence pairs, implementing and explaining text preprocessing functions (lowercasing, punctuation/number removal, stopword removal, tokenization, lemmatization), choosing and justifying a numerical text representation method (TF-IDF), computing and interpreting Cosine similarity, implementing and interpreting Jaccard similarity, and computing WordNet-based semantic similarity for selected text pairs. Finally, all three similarity methods will be compared, and the findings compiled into this lab report section.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset Description\n",
        "\n",
        "The `sentence_pairs_df` dataset used in this analysis consists of 10 pairs of sentences. Each pair comprises two sentences, `Sentence1` and `Sentence2`, which are designed to exhibit varying degrees of similarity. The dataset includes examples of:\n",
        "*   Highly similar sentences (e.g., rephrased versions or identical content).\n",
        "*   Moderately similar sentences (e.g., using synonyms or slight variations in phrasing).\n",
        "*   Dissimilar sentences with no apparent semantic or lexical relationship.\n",
        "*   Sentences demonstrating syntactic variations (different word order).\n",
        "*   Sentences where synonyms are used to convey the same meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this diverse dataset is to serve as a robust testbed for evaluating the performance and characteristics of different text similarity metrics under various linguistic conditions, allowing for a thorough understanding of their strengths and limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preprocessing Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "Text preprocessing is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that transforms raw text into a more suitable and analyzable format. This process helps to reduce noise, standardize text, and improve the performance of subsequent NLP tasks such as text similarity analysis. The following steps were applied:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Lowercasing**: All characters in the text were converted to lowercase. This ensures that words like \"Apple\" and \"apple\" are treated as the same, standardizing the text and reducing vocabulary size.\n",
        "2.  **Punctuation and Number Removal**: Punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas) and numerical digits were eliminated. These characters typically do not contribute to semantic meaning and can introduce noise.\n",
        "3.  **Tokenization**: The text was broken down into individual words or tokens. This segmentation prepares the text for further word-level analysis.\n",
        "4.  **Stopword Removal**: Common words (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"a\") that frequently appear but carry little semantic meaning were removed. This step reduces dimensionality and focuses the analysis on more significant terms.\n",
        "5.  **Lemmatization**: Inflected words were reduced to their base or dictionary form (lemma). For instance, \"running\", \"runs\", and \"ran\" are all reduced to \"run\". This helps to group different forms of a word, improving the accuracy of semantic analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "These steps were combined into a `preprocess_text_pipeline` function, applied to both sentence columns, and stored as lists of tokens in `Processed_Sentence1` and `Processed_Sentence2` columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cosine Similarity Results\n",
        "\n",
        "Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space. In text analysis, these vectors typically represent documents (or sentences) and are often derived from TF-IDF values. A cosine similarity score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates identical content, 0 indicates no commonality, and values in between represent varying degrees of similarity. For this analysis, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) was chosen for numerical text representation due to its ability to downplay common words and emphasize significant terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are illustrative examples from our `sentence_pairs_df` with their Cosine Similarity scores:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Pair 0: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" vs \"A cat sat on the mat.\"**\n",

        "    *   **Cosine Similarity: 1.000000**\n",
        "    *   **Interpretation:** This pair has a perfect similarity score of 1.0. After preprocessing, both sentences become identical lists of tokens, resulting in perfectly aligned TF-IDF vectors. This high score accurately reflects their shared core meaning.\n",

        "2.  **Pair 1: \"He is a fast runner.\" vs \"He runs quickly.\"**\n",

        "### Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective of this laboratory exercise is to perform a comprehensive text similarity analysis using various methods. This involves defining and preparing a dataset of sentence pairs, implementing and explaining text preprocessing functions (lowercasing, punctuation/number removal, stopword removal, tokenization, lemmatization), choosing and justifying a numerical text representation method (TF-IDF), computing and interpreting Cosine similarity, implementing and interpreting Jaccard similarity, and computing WordNet-based semantic similarity for selected text pairs. Finally, all three similarity methods will be compared, and the findings compiled into this lab report section.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset Description\n",
        "\n",
        "The `sentence_pairs_df` dataset used in this analysis consists of 10 pairs of sentences. Each pair comprises two sentences, `Sentence1` and `Sentence2`, which are designed to exhibit varying degrees of similarity. The dataset includes examples of:\n",
        "*   Highly similar sentences (e.g., rephrased versions or identical content).\n",
        "*   Moderately similar sentences (e.g., using synonyms or slight variations in phrasing).\n",
        "*   Dissimilar sentences with no apparent semantic or lexical relationship.\n",
        "*   Sentences demonstrating syntactic variations (different word order).\n",
        "*   Sentences where synonyms are used to convey the same meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this diverse dataset is to serve as a robust testbed for evaluating the performance and characteristics of different text similarity metrics under various linguistic conditions, allowing for a thorough understanding of their strengths and limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preprocessing Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "Text preprocessing is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that transforms raw text into a more suitable and analyzable format. This process helps to reduce noise, standardize text, and improve the performance of subsequent NLP tasks such as text similarity analysis. The following steps were applied:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Lowercasing**: All characters in the text were converted to lowercase. This ensures that words like \"Apple\" and \"apple\" are treated as the same, standardizing the text and reducing vocabulary size.\n",
        "2.  **Punctuation and Number Removal**: Punctuation marks (e.g., periods, commas) and numerical digits were eliminated. These characters typically do not contribute to semantic meaning and can introduce noise.\n",
        "3.  **Tokenization**: The text was broken down into individual words or tokens. This segmentation prepares the text for further word-level analysis.\n",
        "4.  **Stopword Removal**: Common words (e.g., \"the\", \"is\", \"a\") that frequently appear but carry little semantic meaning were removed. This step reduces dimensionality and focuses the analysis on more significant terms.\n",
        "5.  **Lemmatization**: Inflected words were reduced to their base or dictionary form (lemma). For instance, \"running\", \"runs\", and \"ran\" are all reduced to \"run\". This helps to group different forms of a word, improving the accuracy of semantic analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "These steps were combined into a `preprocess_text_pipeline` function, applied to both sentence columns, and stored as lists of tokens in `Processed_Sentence1` and `Processed_Sentence2` columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cosine Similarity Results\n",
        "\n",
        "Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space. In text analysis, these vectors typically represent documents (or sentences) and are often derived from TF-IDF values. A cosine similarity score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates identical content, 0 indicates no commonality, and values in between represent varying degrees of similarity. For this analysis, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) was chosen for numerical text representation due to its ability to downplay common words and emphasize significant terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are illustrative examples from our `sentence_pairs_df` with their Cosine Similarity scores:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Pair 0: \"The cat sat on the mat.\" vs \"A cat sat on the mat.\"**\n",

        "*   **Robust Preprocessing Pipeline**: A comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline was successfully implemented, including lowercasing, punctuation/number removal, stopword removal, tokenization, and lemmatization. This pipeline was consistently applied to standardize the text data.\n",
        "*   **TF-IDF for Text Representation**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) was selected and justified over Bag-of-Words for numerical text representation, effectively generating feature matrices for the sentence pairs (e.g., for 10 pairs, the TF-IDF matrices were of shape $(10, 50)$).\n",
        "*   **Cosine Similarity**:\n",
        "    *   Demonstrated high accuracy for sentences with strong lexical overlap (e.g., \"The cat sat on the mat.\" vs \"A cat sat on the mat.\" yielded a score of $1.00$).\n",
        "    *   Struggled with semantically related but lexically distinct phrases (e.g., \"He is a fast runner.\" vs \"He runs quickly.\" both scored $0.00$), highlighting its reliance on exact word matches.\n",
        "    *   Showed moderate scores for structural variations with significant lexical overlap (e.g., \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" vs \"A lazy dog was jumped over by the quick brown fox.\" scored $0.79$).\n",
        "*   **Jaccard Similarity**:\n",
        "    *   Similar to Cosine similarity, Jaccard scores were high for strong lexical overlap (e.g., $1.00$ for identical processed sentences) and low for lexically dissimilar but semantically related sentences ($0.00$ for \"He is a fast runner.\" vs \"He runs quickly.\").\n",
        "    *   Slight differences were observed compared to Cosine, particularly when TF-IDF weighting played a role (e.g., \"quick brown fox...\" pair scored $0.79$ with Cosine vs $0.71$ with Jaccard).\n",
        "*   **WordNet-based Semantic Similarity**:\n",
        "    *   Significantly outperformed lexical methods in capturing semantic relationships between different words. For instance, \"He is a fast runner.\" vs \"He runs quickly.\" scored $0.42$ with WordNet, compared to $0.00$ for Cosine and Jaccard.\n",
        "    *   Successfully identified high similarity for synonyms and related concepts (e.g., \"I love eating apples.\" vs \"I enjoy consuming apples.\" scored $1.00$; \"The car is red.\" vs \"The vehicle is crimson.\" scored $0.92$; \"She purchased a new automobile.\" vs \"She bought a new car.\" scored $0.67$), demonstrating its ability to go beyond simple lexical matching.\n",
        "*   **Method Comparison**: A comparison highlighted that while Cosine and Jaccard are effective for lexical overlap, WordNet is superior for understanding semantic intent, especially for short texts and when synonyms are involved. Disagreements in scores primarily arose when sentences had semantically similar but lexically distinct words.\n",

        "*   **Advanced Semantic Models**: To further improve semantic similarity detection, especially for complex or abstract concepts not well-covered by WordNet, consider exploring advanced techniques like word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) or contextual embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa) that capture distributional semantics.\n"
